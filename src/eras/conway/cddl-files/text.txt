When a node gets a block with all the TXs.

The block has: 
    an array of all the transaction_bodies,
    an array of all the transaction_witness_sets for the transaction_bodies,

    Then it verifys that all the transaction_bodies are signed by the transaction_witness_sets

    since only the body gets signed, which ever body doesn't have a proper witness set signature it adds the tx index to the invalid_transactions array?
